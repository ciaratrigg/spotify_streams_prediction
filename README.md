# Predicting Streams of Songs on Spotify
This repository contains my semester project assignment for the course 
[DS 362: Data-Driven Knowledge Discovery](https://knowledge-discovery.netlify.app/) as taught during 
the Fall 2023 semester at the [University of Scranton](https://www.scranton.edu/) by 
[Professor Jason Graham.](https://sites.google.com/site/jasonmgrahamus/)

One may find in this repository:
- The data needed to reproduce the analyses, see [data](https://github.com/ciaratrigg/spotify_streams_prediction/tree/main/data) folder. This data was originally published as a Kaggle dataset by [Nidula Elgiriyewithana](https://www.kaggle.com/nelgiriyewithana) and can be accessed [here.](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nelgiriyewithana/top-spotify-songs-2023)
